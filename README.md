A Game Boy Emulator in C++ using only an Assembly Language Commands, Timings and Opcodes manual titled _Game Boyâ„¢ CPU Manual_ by: Pan of Anthrox, GABY, Marat Fayzullin, Pascal Felber, Paul Robson, Martin Korth, kOOPa, Bowser.

## Aim

* Find out how emulators work
* Further knowledge about low-level computing
* To play one my favourite Game Boy games [Donkey Kong 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(1994_video_game))

## Visual Studio

Please use at least MicroSoft Visual Studio 2019 version 16.11. To get started, open this file as project/solution: [./GameBoyEmulator/GameBoyEmulator.sln](./GameBoyEmulator/GameBoyEmulator.sln)

## Tests

See [./GameBoyEmulatorTests](./GameBoyEmulatorTests) for unit tests. This was implemented after getting stuck with buggy opcodes implementation.

### Rom Tests

I found a number of different test gameboy roms. Thank you Blargg!
